Minimum Operations Project
This Python project aims to calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform a file containing a single character 'H' to a file with exactly 'n' occurrences of 'H'. The only allowed operations are "Copy All" and "Paste."

Usage
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-interview.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd alx-interview/0x02-minimum_operations
Run the test script:

bash
Copy code
./0-main.py
Method Implementation
The core functionality is provided by the minOperations method in the 0-minoperations.py file. This method calculates the minimum number of operations needed to achieve 'n' occurrences of 'H' in the file.

python
Copy code
def minOperations(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0

    operations = 0
    divisor = 2

    while n > 1:
        while n % divisor == 0:
            operations += divisor
            n //= divisor
        divisor += 1

    return operations

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n1 = 4
    print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n1, minOperations(n1)))

    n2 = 12
    print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n2, minOperations(n2)))
Example Output
bash
Copy code
Min # of operations to reach 4 char: 4
Min # of operations to reach 12 char: 7
