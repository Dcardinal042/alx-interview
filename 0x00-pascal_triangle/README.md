Project 0x00: Pascal's Triangle
Overview
This project involves the implementation of Pascal's Triangle in Python. Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical concept that produces a triangular array of binomial coefficients. The goal is to create a function, pascal_triangle(n), that returns a list of lists representing Pascal's Triangle up to the nth row.
